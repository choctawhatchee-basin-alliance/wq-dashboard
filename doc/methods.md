<h4 style = 'text-align: center'>Volunteer Training</h4>

<p>Citizen volunteers receive hands-on training from CBA staff following standardized Florida LAKEWATCH and CBA procedures. Training sessions, which last between two and four hours, take place at CBA headquarters or directly on the water. Volunteers are assigned three to five stations based on their preferred water body and are required to conduct monthly sampling. CBA staff maintain regular communication with volunteers, providing ongoing support, materials, and ongoing training as needed.</p>
 
<h4 style = 'text-align: center'>Field Sampling</h4>

<p>CBA’s water quality stations are typically accessed via boat, canoe, or kayak, except for shallow streams where wading is possible. Volunteers and staff adhere to Florida LAKEWATCH procedures to collect samples and measure water clarity using a Secchi disk.</p>

<p>Samples collected for laboratory analysis include:</p>

* 250mL Nalgene bottle – Total Phosphorus and Total Nitrogen
* 1000mL opaque plastic bottle – Chlorophyll-a

<p>Field parameters recorded on-site include:</p>

* Temperature (°F)
* Dissolved Oxygen (DO) (mg/L)
* DO Percent Saturation (%)
* Specific Conductivity (mS/cm)
* pH
* Salinity (ppt)
* Turbidity (NTU)

<h4 style = 'text-align: center'>Sample Storage and Handling</h4>

<p>At the conclusion of each sampling event, nutrient samples are frozen for preservation. Chlorophyll-a samples are filtered according to Florida LAKEWATCH guidelines, stored over silica gel desiccant, and frozen. All samples and completed datasheets are delivered to CBA headquarters and transferred to the LAKEWATCH laboratory on a quarterly basis.</p>

<h4 style = 'text-align: center'>Quality Assurance</h4>

<p>CBA partners with the Florida LAKEWATCH laboratory to ensure compliance with rigorous water sample analysis standards. All sampling bottles, filtering devices, and supplies are provided by the Florida LAKEWATCH laboratory and inspected upon arrival by CBA staff.</p>

<p>To maintain data integrity, CBA:</p>

* Stores samples in a walk-in freezer maintained at -10°C.
* Conducts regular calibration and checks of field water quality meters used by staff and volunteers.
* Implements strict data entry and validation procedures, addressing discrepancies on a case-by-case basis.
* Retains all original datasheets for a minimum of five years

<h4 style = 'text-align: center'>Reference Lines</h4>

<p>Several graphics on this dashboard include reference lines for Numeric Nutrient Criteria (NNC) for total phosphorus, total nitrogen, and chloropyll-a.  These reference lines vary by WBID and are based on 62-302.531, and 62-302.532, F.A.C.</p>
