<h4 style = 'text-align: center'>Using this Tab</h4>

<p>This tab provides a comparison of parameters at the same location. Begin by choosing a date range and parameters to compare using the selections above the maps.</p>

<p>The maps show the mean values using a color gradient for the selected parameters and date range. Mousing over a station on the map will show additional information. The example below shows information for summarized station including the waterbody and station identifier and the mean value of the parameter for the date range.</p>

<p>The controls on the map can also be used to zoom in or change the base layer.  Map zooming and panning can also be done using the mouse.</p>

<p>Clicking a station on the map will highlight the selection and open the far right tab showing additional information. A station selected on one map will also be highlighted on the other map. A time series plot for the selected station will appear on the far right, showing values for the two parameters in the maps. Values for the left map are shown on the top and values for the right map are shown on the bottom. If available, relevant numeric nutrient criteria (NNC) are also shown on the plots as red lines. Note that these values are provided as reference only and cannot be used for regulatory assessment. Mousing over the plot will show additional information for the date and value at that point in the time series.</p>

<br>

<p>The time series plots can also be summarized by means for different time periods. Available options are by day, year, season (winter, spring, summer, fall), winter (December, January, February), spring (March, April, May), summer (June, July, August), fall (September, October, November), wet season (June through September), or dry season (October through May). If summaries are by season, mean values within each season are plotted on the first month of the selected season or seasons. Confidence intervals (95%) are provided for the time period if year or season summaries are selected.</p>

<p>A trend line showing the linear fit to the data can also be included by selecting an option from the top right menu.  Selecting "complete" will fit a line to the complete period of record for each plot.  Selecting "shortest" will fit a line to the shortest period of time shared between the two plots.  Selecting "ten years" will fit a line to the most recent ten year period for each plot. The trend line is not shown if ten years of data are not available for a plot.</p>

<p>The hamburger icon on the top right of each plot can be used to view the plot in full screen, download the plot as a png, or download the plot data as a csv.</p>
